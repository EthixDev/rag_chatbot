The App lets the user to ask questions about the documents. the App searches the best response in the vector database and the content retrieved from the database is passed to the GEMINI model, which generates a response based on the question, chat history and content fro the vector database.

## Getting Started With Code

To use this app, you need a Google GEMINI API Key. To get the Google GEMINI API use this link [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey), then create a new API key by clicking the `Create API Key` option. After creating the API key, you need to copy it and paste the key in a new txt file or else where, so that you can put it in the `.env` file after creating it.

### Step 1: Clone repository to your local machine:
Clone the App repo in the local machine

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/EthixDev/rag_chatbot.git
```

### Step 2: Create .env file
Navigate to the app folder where the files README and requirements are located,

```shell
cd rag_chatbot
```
Then create `.env` file in the app folder.

Now, paste the API key that you generated into the quotation marks. It should look something like this:

```shell
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "apikey"
```
### Step 3: Install Packages
Before install packages, Create a virtual environment to access the dependencies.

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

To activate the virtual environment:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate     # For linux
```
```shell
.venv/Scripts/activate       # For windows 
```

Open a terminal in this folder, write this to install all the requirements for the app:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Run the docker compose
In this same terminal, run this command to startup the app:

```shell
docker compose up --build
```

### Step 5: Run the App server
Open your web browser and visit the chatbot URL defined in your project's URL configuration (http://localhost:8080/). This should render your chatbot interface.
